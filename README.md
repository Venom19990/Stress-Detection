# Stress-Detection
Summary:
     The Purpose of Stress Detection Project was to detect stress from the Employees working in an Organisation and to rectify those employess so that they get rid of it 
   and perform well for there organisation.
   
   
# Life-Cycle of the Project:
     Data Collection / Gathering.
     Data Pre-processing.
     Model Selection. 
     Training the model for Accuracy Merics.    
     Deployment of the model using Flask.
   
# Algorithm Used:
    Classification Algorithm: Naiye-Bias Classifier.
    The Problem Statement is an Classic Example of a Classification Problem i.e Eiher the Problem Would Have Stress or Not have Stress i.e YES/NO.
    
    
# Libraries Includes:
    Pandas
    Numpy
    RegularExpression
    Natural-language-toolkit
    sci-kit learn
    Bernoulli-NaiveBayes()
    
# Working:
  The Machine Learning Model would take a input from the user of how was HIS/HER day was and based on that input
   the Model Would Predict that Wheather the Person is Undergoing Stress or Not.

# Motivation and purpose of the project:
     As we know Depression and mental health is a very common problem in this generation. Lot of people are facing this issue and specially in IT industry
     this stress reaches to its peak which affects the employees Performance.
     So, main purpose was to detect stress from those Employees and provide a Healthy solution to them.
